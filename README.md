# IBM Data Science Capstone – Project Overview
 
Adapted and completed by **Vincent de Paul Ntihinyurwa**, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics and Information Systems at Texas State University.
Original course developed by Dr. Joseph Santarcangelo, Dr. Yan Luo, and Azim Hirjani (IBM Data Science Capstone, Coursera).
In this capstone project, I applied the full data science workflow by taking on the role of a Data Scientist for a private space launch company. The project involved:
# •	Data Collection: Gathering relevant datasets from multiple sources using APIs and web scraping.
# •	Data Wrangling: Cleaning and refining raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
# •	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring data patterns, trends, and relationships through SQL queries and visualizations.
# •	Statistical and Predictive Modeling: Applying statistical analysis and building predictive models to uncover meaningful insights.
# •	Storytelling with Data: Creating a structured presentation that translates technical findings into actionable business insights.

This capstone brought together all the key skills learned throughout the IBM Data Science capstone project, including data collection, preparation, analysis, and model development, into a real-world, end-to-end data science project.
